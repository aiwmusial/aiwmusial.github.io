In the difficult times of COVID, when pretty much all of the travels were banned, I started dreaming about going places again and reviewing countries suitable to spend my future holidays in. 
One of the most important aspects of trip planning is estimating the overall cost of the trip and secure sufficient funds. There is no point in going to a place, where we cannot afford anything. 
I spend some time browsing through the guidebooks and the internet forums to find an estimation on how much money per day is it necessary to have, in order to support yourself when traveling.
I decided to present my findings in a small app. Please see how it works and try it out yourself!



## How does it work?

#### First of all, you have to select the country you wish to travel to by clicking on the map. Please note that if you hover over each country - the name of the country will display.

#### After you selected the country, you can see that the estimated daily trip cost is displayed. The next task is to choose the length of the trip.

#### When you selected the country of your choice and the number of days you wish to travel for, an estimated cost of your overall trip is displayed in Polish zloty. 
##### Please note that all currencies are displayed as per the daily NBP (Narodowy Bank Polski) currency exchange rate.
