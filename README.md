</p>

<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap 5</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap 5 is a great tool to ensure that the website is responsive. However, the page still requires to be tested on various screen sizes, including real devices, not only using the developer tools within the browser.</li>
<li>Viewing the source of other websites can be a great place to get inspired and learn new things that can be used on my project.</li>
<li>When learning programming, there is an ambition to do everything from the scratch. But it is also important to remember that there are tools, programs and websites that can simplyfy our work. It is good to get challenged, but it is also is important to assess what is worth spending time on and what can be simplyfied.</li>
</ul>
